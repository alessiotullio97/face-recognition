# PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Design and implementation of a biometric module using MATLAB or OpenCV, in group
(strongly suggested).

## BS MODULE:
- A BS module using MATLAB or OPENCV

### Module Specifications
- To Define...

## RERPORT:
- A detailed report of the project

### Report Specification
[] external sources that were used
[] "original" (i.e. the improved or created one) code to build the final application. 
[] Perfomance Evaluation

## PRESENTATION:
A presentation in powerpoint or whatever and a demo must be prepared to present the
project.

### Presentation Specs
underline any design choice you had to make in order to have:
[] the application work
[] clear architecture structure to highlight the parts of code taken from libraries
and the part of code developed by you.

## PERFOMANCE EVALUATION:
You have to carry out a thorough performance evaluation, possibly in
verification mode, and results must be reported in the report.
