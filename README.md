# PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Design and implementation of a face recognition biometric module using MATLAB.

## Biometric System Steps

// The following has to be refined according to the final implementation 

1. face capture and possible image enhancement
2. face localization
3. possible cropping of 1+ regions of interests (ROIs)
4. Components Identification (eyes, nose, mounth, ...)
5. Normalization
6. Feature Extraction
7. Template construction

### Module Specifications
- To Define...


## RERPORT:
- A detailed report of the project

### Report Specification
[] external sources that were used
[] "original" (i.e. the improved or created one) code to build the final application. 
[] Perfomance Evaluation

## PRESENTATION:
A presentation in powerpoint or whatever and a demo must be prepared to present the
project.

### Presentation Specs
underline any design choice you had to make in order to have:
[] the application work
[] clear architecture structure to highlight the parts of code taken from libraries
and the part of code developed by you.

## PERFOMANCE EVALUATION:
You have to carry out a thorough performance evaluation, possibly in
verification mode, and results must be reported in the report.
